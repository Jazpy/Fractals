# OpenGL Fractals

A series of random fractals written in C++ using OpenGL.

## Prerequisites

In order to compile this project, the following must be installed:

- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM
- OpenGL 3.3+

Please check [this site](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/) for instructions. You can also check the tutorials this is based off of at @opengl-tutorials

## Building

Use the `CMakeLists.txt` file to generate a makefile inside the `build/` directory. I recommend using `cmake-gui` for this. Then simply use the `make` command. An executable named `genominator` should be generated.
